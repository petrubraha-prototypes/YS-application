# Yoda-Syntax

java project
input: large text
output: same text with `conditions` - correct accidental assignements in code

## conditions

- centred only on the following relational operators: `=` `==` `!=`
- in an expression, the order of parameters is: `constant then object`
- no modifications for `constant then constant` statements
- a `constant` is a rvalue, anything like:
  - const primitive/non-primitive
  - pointer to functions
  - preprocessed variables
  - typeid
- statements to consider: `if` `while` `for` `condition operator - ?`

## steps

- assume there are no syntax/semantic errors
- store constant names
- read the text in chunks
- modify each chunk individually, if needed
- determine accidental assignments and ask the user for improvement
- print on standard output the result

## log

- no: discard any adjustment if the output of the code is different
- no: other operators => redability, purposeless
- no: run an entire project
- i assumed that every operator problem can appear only in if while for ? statements. it was wrong
